Information about the Additional 1 and Additional 2 exams to be used by senior undergraduate students who could not graduate despite completing the maximum education period
============================================================================================================================================================================

1.  According to Article 44/c of Law No. 2547, senior students enrolled in the undergraduate programs of our university, who cannot graduate at the end of the maximum 7-year maximum education period from the date they started their undergraduate education, are given the right to 2 additional exams, additional exam 1 and additional exam 2 on the dates announced in the academic calendar for all 6 or more courses that they have never taken or have taken and failed before within the maximum education period.
2.  Students whose 7-year maximum education period expires at the end of the Spring semester will use their additional 1 exam rights at the end of the following Fall semester and their additional 2 exam rights at the end of the Spring semester. Students whose 7-year maximum education period expires at the end of the Fall semester will use their additional 1 exam rights at the end of the following Spring semester and their additional 2 exam rights at the end of the Fall semester.
3.  The exam registrations of the students who use the additional exam right will be made by the Registrar's Office. These students continue to pay the tuition fee per course in which they take the exam. However, these students cannot benefit from other student rights other than exam rights.
4.  Students who are successful in the first addtional exam cannot take the second additional exam of the same course in order to raise their grades. Students who do not use the first additional exam right can use the second additional exam right. There are no make-up exams for the first and second additional exams.
5.  In theoretical courses, the grades obtained in the first and second addtional exams are evaluated alone and converted into letter grades. Grades taken during the semester are not taken into account.In practice courses; the first and second addtional exams will not be applied as a single exam, but as an application course covering the whole semester. The grades will be calculated according to the Regulation on Undergraduate Education and Training: "The semester grade is the weighted average of the studies, assignments, projects, midterm exams, quizzes and similar activities carried out during the semester. At the beginning of the semester, the semester grade of the course and the weighted calculation values must be shown on the course curriculum form."
    
6.  The letter success grade of the course achieved by using the additional exam right is recorded in the semester in which studenst use the additional exam right and reflected in the transcript.
7.  At the end of the first and second additional exams, students who fail to reduce the number of failed courses to a maximum of five courses, including the courses they have never taken or have taken but cannot be entitled to take the exam, are dismissed from the University.
8.  At the end of the first and second additional exams, students who have at least one and at most five courses remaining in the curriculum for graduation, including the courses that have never been taken before or have been taken but cannot be entitled to take the exam, are given three semesters, and those who reduce the number of failed courses to five courses without taking additional exams are given an additional four semesters.
9.  Students who are given additional time will register for the courses to be opened and take the exams of the course on the dates announced in the academic calendar. Among these courses, attendance is compulsory only for applied courses and courses that have never been taken before or courses that have been taken before but have not been entitled to take the exam. The success grade to be given to the student whose attendance is not required is evaluated by the lecturer of the course, taking into account the in-semester studies and the final exam result, except for the attendance requirement.
10.  Students who are given additional time have to pay the tuition fee of the relevant semester. These students benefit from student rights.
