For the conversion of grades, if the equivalents of the course grades in the education document (transcript) in the 4 and 100 system are not included in the document, the officially approved equivalents to be taken from the higher education institution where the student has previously studied are also taken into consideration. The 100 system equivalents of the grades will be calculated by using the current YÖK Table.

(University Senate 21.09.2023-844) In the course plan of the undergraduate program in which the student is accepted at ITU, the courses that are considered equivalent to the course evaluated with a letter grade (BL) because they are non-credit and have a letter grade of BL (Successful), Passed, etc. are also adjusted.

It was discussed at the meeting of the University Senate dated 28.09.2023, numbered 845 and changes were made in the Grade Conversion table of Exemption and Adjustment Procedures.
