***   English Courses****a) ING 112A "Foundations of Academic Writing" course;**The ING 112A course, included in the course plans after the Fall Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year, is 2 credits. Students subject to the course plans before the Fall Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year will also register for the ING 112A course. Students with the ING 112 course in their course plans will not encounter the ING 100 course as a prerequisite when registering for the ING 112A course. However, students subject to the course plans after the Fall Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year must fulfill the ING100 course requirement, and students who register for the ING 112A course without passing the ING 100 course will have their course registration dropped due to not meeting the enrollment condition.

**b) ING 201A "Writing an English Research Paper" course;**The ING 201A course, included in the course plans after the Fall Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year, is 2 credits.

Students subject to the course plans before the Fall Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year will also register for the ING 201A course. The ING201 course is equivalent to the ING201A course. Students enrolled in this course in previous plans will not face any graduation issues, although it will reduce the total credits required for graduation.

**c) ING 101 and ING 102**Students subject to plans before the Fall Semester of 2017-2018 who have taken the ING 101 or ING 102 coded courses cannot take the ING 112A course. These students, if they wish to repeat their courses, will retake the courses with the same code, ING 101 or ING 102.

**d) ING 103**Students who have taken the ING 112 and ING 201 coded courses can take the ING 103 coded courses, listed under the "General Education" elective course group in their course plan, as elective courses.

***   Foreign Language Courses Opened by the School of Foreign Languages with "ITA", "ISP", "FRA", "ALM", "JPN", "RUS", "CIN" Codes**a- Foreign Language Courses, included as non-credit in the undergraduate program course plans, have been added to the ITB group as 3-credit courses for students included in the latest plan (Fall Semester of 2017-2018 and later), as of the Spring Semester of the 2018-2019 Academic Year, in accordance with the University Senate decision dated 29 November 2018 and numbered 689. If these courses are taken, the letter grades received at the end of the semester will be recorded on the transcript, affecting both the graduation credits and the GPA.

b- Students included in the plans of the Fall Semester of 2017-2018 and later must complete the ITB credits if they passed the foreign language courses added to the ITB before the Spring Semester of 2018-2019 (as these courses were non-credit at that time).

c- Students included in the plans before the Fall Semester of 2017-2018 can take these courses, but they will not count towards the graduation credits.

***   Attention to Students Whose Maximum Duration Will Expire at the End of the 2023-2024 Academic Year**It is recommended that students select their courses by reviewing Article 14, which is under the title of "Duration and Form of Education" in the ITU Undergraduate Education and Training Regulations.
