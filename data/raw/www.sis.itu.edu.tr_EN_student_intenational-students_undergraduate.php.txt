UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
======================

ITU offers 102 undergraduate programs from natural sciences to various disciplines of engineering, architecture, planning, arts, and design. ITU students gain strong academic background to develop required skills and creative thinking.

ITU students learn to explore the dimensions of academic landscape, develop necessary skills in leadership, complex problem solving, active learning and critical thinking. Besides their core curriculum classes, students design their own path of learning through electives in various fields in line with their own interests.

The basis of our educational philosophy is to combine theory and practice and allow for specialization in different topics.

You may see the undergraduate programs of ITU [here](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en/all-departments)

**Language of Instruction at ITU**

An English Proficiency test result accepted by ITU Senate need to be submitted during registration to take courses at undergraduate programs. Students who cannot provide an English Proficiency exam score will be required to complete English Preparation Course in ITU's School of Foreign Languages for one year.

Students who submit a valid English Proficiency Exam result during registration will be exempted from the English Preparatory Class and will be able to directly start the undergraduate program they have been accepted to.

Students who are accepted to the departments the medium of instruction is 100% English are required to submit at least a B1 level Turkish Proficiency Certificate obtained by the centers determined by the ITU Senate within one (1) year from the date of registration.

Students who are accepted to departments of the faculties which the medium of instruction is 30% English and students who are accepted to the Turkish Music State Conservatory (except for the 100% English-taught Musicology program) are required to submit a C1 level Turkish Proficiency Certificate to the Student Registrar’s Office. The certificate must be obtained from centers determined by the ITU Senate within one (1) year from the date of registration in order to start the program in which they have registered. Students who cannot submit the Turkish Proficiency Certificate during this period are considered on leave for an additional 1 (one) year. International students who do not have a Turkish Proficiency Certificate cannot be included in English preparatory or department courses. Students who submit their Turkish Proficiency Certificate at the end of the legal period are subjected to English preparatory education. Students who do not submit their Turkish Proficiency Certificate within the legal deadlines will be disenrolled by the Registrar's Office.

You may reach the foreign language exams accepted by the ITU Senate and the minimum scores, [**here**](https://www.sis.itu.edu.tr/TR/mevzuat/english-geverli-sinavlar.php) .
