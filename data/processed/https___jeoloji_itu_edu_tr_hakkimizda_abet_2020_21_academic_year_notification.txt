**ITU Geological Engineering Undergraduate Program - 2020-21 Academic Year Notification to Students and Faculty**

The ITU Geological Engineering Undergraduate Program is a 4-year program accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET. As of 28 August 2020, the program is in a “Show Cause Review” period to ensure compliance with accreditation criteria.

**Reason(s) for the period:**
The program needs to provide sufficient documentation that all students complete a major design experience involving the design of a system, component, or process to meet desired needs, incorporating appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints.

**Remedial actions starting in the 2020-21 Fall term:**

1. **RAD-01:** Restructuring of courses, including the incorporation of the _JEO350 Basic Principles in Engineering Design and Methods_ course content into the _JEO4901 Geological Engineering Design I_ course. A coordinator and a team of instructors have been appointed for uniform implementation.
   
2. **RAD-02:** Planned replacement of the 3rd year elective _JEO350 Basic Principles in Engineering Design and Methods_ course with a new course titled _“Geophysical Methods in Geological Engineering.”_

3. An application form will be required for the _JEO4902 Geological Engineering Design II_ course, similar to the form used for the former _JEO492 Graduation Design Project_.

4. The ITU GEUP and Department Administration conducted online meetings to inform academic personnel and students about the accreditation status and the remedial actions starting in the 2020-21 Fall term.
