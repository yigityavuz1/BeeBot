**Title: ABET**

**Program Overview:**
- ITU Geological Engineering Undergraduate Program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET.

**Mission:**
- To educate professionals capable of solving geology-related problems in various sectors using science and technology.

**Program Educational Objectives (PEOs):**
1. Develop and implement geotechnical engineering designs (tunnels, dams, bridges).
2. Engage in groundwater explorations and problem-solving.
3. Participate in exploration programs for resources.
4. Conduct soil classifications and plan engineering structures with environmental considerations.
5. Transform research projects into academic studies.

**Student Outcomes (SOs):**
1. Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems.
2. Apply engineering design to meet specified needs considering various factors.
3. Communicate effectively with diverse audiences.
4. Recognize ethical responsibilities in engineering.
5. Function effectively in teams.
6. Conduct experiments and analyze data.
7. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed.
