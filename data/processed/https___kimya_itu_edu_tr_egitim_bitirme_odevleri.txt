**Title: Bitirme Ödevleri**

**Overview:**
- Every semester, each student fills out a form indicating their preferred faculty members for their graduation project and submits it to the Department Chair. Students must list 3 faculty members.
- The distribution of students to faculty members is managed by the Department Council, ensuring that each faculty member supervises a maximum of 2 students per academic year.
- Graduation projects can be laboratory work or comprehensive research on a given topic; mere translations are not accepted.
- Before exams, students must submit their thesis in file form to the Department Chair, and after necessary corrections, the thesis is bound for library submission.
- The graduation project exam is open to other faculty members, but only the exam committee can ask questions. Grading is based on:
  - Written presentation: 50%
  - Oral presentation: 20%
  - Defense: 30%
- The graduation project form is submitted to the Department Chair by the supervising faculty member.
