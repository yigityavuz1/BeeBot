**Why ABET Accreditation Matters**

ABET accreditation assures confidence that a collegiate program has met standards essential to prepare graduates to enter critical STEM fields in the global workforce. Graduates from an ABET-accredited program have a solid educational foundation and are capable of leading the way in innovation, emerging technologies, and in anticipating the welfare and safety needs of the public.

### Students

Your degree is a significant achievement and perhaps the largest investment you will make toward your future. The quality of education you receive makes a big difference in your career success. ABET accreditation:

- Verifies that your educational experience meets the global standard for technical education in your profession.
- Enhances your employment opportunities—multinational corporations require graduation from an accredited program.
- Supports your entry to a technical profession through licensure, registration, and certification—all of which often require graduation from an ABET-accredited program as a minimum qualification.
- Establishes your eligibility for many federal student loans, grants, and/or scholarships.
- Paves the way for you to work globally, because ABET accreditation is recognized worldwide through international agreements.

### Institutions

The ABET accreditation review process is an intensive team effort, and program accreditation is voluntary in the U.S. The process yields data and insights that can be used to deliver the best educational experience for students. 

ABET accreditation tells prospective students, peers, and the professions served that a program:

- Has received international recognition of its quality.
- Promotes “best practices” in education.
- Directly involves faculty and staff in self-assessment and continuous quality improvement processes.
- Is based on “learning outcomes,” rather than “teaching inputs.”

### Global

When ABET’s quality standards are applied and promoted globally, the results are a better-educated, geographically mobile, diverse technical workforce well-prepared to advance innovation and excel professionally in fields of critical importance to society.

ABET accreditation criteria are developed by technical professionals, members of ABET's 34 member societies. This third-party peer review is critical in the technical fields, where quality, precision, and safety are of utmost importance.

ABET accreditation:

- Ensures that graduates have met the educational requirements necessary to enter the profession.
- Provides opportunities for the industry to guide the educational process to reflect current and future needs.
- Enhances the mobility of professionals.

Responsive to increasing globalization, ABET works to ensure that graduates of ABET-accredited programs can employ their talents internationally.
