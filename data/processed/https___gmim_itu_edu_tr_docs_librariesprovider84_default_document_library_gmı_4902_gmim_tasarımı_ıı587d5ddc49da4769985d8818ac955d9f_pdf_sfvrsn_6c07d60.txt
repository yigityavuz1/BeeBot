**Semester:** 8  
**Local Credits:** 4  
**ECTS Credits:** 8  
**Course Implementation (Hours/Week):** 1 Theoretical, 6 Practical  
**Department/Program:** Marine Engineering  
**Course Type:** Compulsory  
**Course Language:** Turkish  
**Course Prerequisites:** GMI 4901 MIN BB or GMI 4901E MIN BB  

**Course Description:**  
GMI 4901 and 4902 design courses allow students to gain design project skills from selection to completion using the knowledge acquired during their undergraduate education. The design of marine engines, systems, or processes is considered through open-ended projects under realistic constraints and ethical considerations. Teams of students work on basic and alternative solutions, and results are presented effectively to a wide audience. GMI 4902 includes the production and subsequent phases of the design process.

**Course Objectives:**  
1. To provide skills to use knowledge of basic science and engineering.  
2. To teach all phases of a design project and provide design experience.  
3. To provide teamwork awareness while improving professional and ethical responsibility.  
4. To teach oral and written presentation skills.  

**Course Learning Outcomes:**  
Students who pass the course can:  
I. Carry out an engineering design study in a team environment and within ethical rules.  
II. Perform iterative analysis and synthesis of available information within constraints.  
III. Reach a scientific solution and specify its positive and negative aspects.  
IV. Report project results in scientific format and defend them effectively in front of a jury.  

**Course Plan:**  
- **Week 1-2:** Research  
- **Week 3-6:** Actual design  
- **Week 7-10:** Design analysis and synthesis  
- **Week 11-14:** Analysis and synthesis of results and report preparation  

**Relationship of the Course to Marine Engineering Student Outcomes:**  
1. Ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems.
