**Residence Permit Application Document**

- Students submitting their residence permit application receive a "Residence Permit Application Document" from the Directorate of Migration Management.
- This document grants the legal right to stay in Turkey for 90 days from the date of application.
- The Residence Permit Application Document serves as a substitute for a Passport or any equivalent document.
- Ten working days after submitting the residence permit application documents to the university, foreigners can leave Turkey briefly and return without waiting for the residence permit card to be issued. This is allowed provided they are within the duration of the requested residence permit and have submitted the receipt of the fees (except those exempted from the fee).
- Foreigners can leave the country without paying a fined residence permit fee at the border gates by presenting the residence permit application document. No visa is required for citizens of countries subject to obtaining a visa for entering Turkey if they return within fifteen (15) days.
- You can receive the exit document by applying to the information desk located on the ground floor of the administration building at Istanbul Directorate of Migration Management (Göç İdaresi).
